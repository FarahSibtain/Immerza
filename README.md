Similar to Headspace XR / Practise Self Love with the following differences:
XR or VR mode
There are 5 nice empty oval pictureframes with “Yourself”, “Good Friend”, “Neutral Person”, “Difficult Person”, “All Sentinent Beings” written above. Should be localized, default language = headset language.  
Introduction Audio is played shortly. “Sitting quietly, imagine a gentle golden-white light flowing down over your head and through your body. As this golden-white light travels through every cell of your body, let go of tension and float in this sea of relaxation.” 

In Quest 2 “At your own time, gently gesture at the person to whom you want to send your loving kindness”.  

In Quest 3 “At your own time, gently gaze at the person to whom you want to send your loving kindness”.
  
“Send energy as long as you want before continuing with the next person or the lotus flower to end this meditation”. 
In the window(s) the stylized faces of these are displayed, a bit like in Headspace
Quest 3: When gazing at one of them, a visualization of light/energy flows towards it and the face glows. Quest 2: Same but triggered by gesture at the window. 

Minimum should be 30 seconds, e.g. a progress indicator of some gradient filling up the oval in the background, a glow around the frame increasing, face smiling more or the like. 

During this phase, see, https://www.iawaketechnologies.com/how-to-develop-compassion-the-5-stages-of-loving-kindness-meditation/ 

So when sending to myself, the audio is “Sending loving kindness to yourself”,  “May I be well.” “May I be happy.” “May I be free from suffering.”. 

When sending to others, the audio is Audio is “Sending loving kindness to…” then name of receiver, e.g. “a friend”, “a difficult person” and then repeating as long as gazing (quest 3) or not gesturing towards another (quest 2) “May you be well”, “May you be happy”, …

Audio with elevenlabs, localized, default Headset language.v
